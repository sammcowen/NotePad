  ## Description

  NotePad is an application that allows users to CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE notes! I built the server and the back-end logic (home and api routes, back end JS,) for this application and connected the two of them together using express.JS

  ## Usage 
  Instructions for use:

  User will arrive at a landing page. Click the button to start creating notes! When the user is directed to the '/notes' page, they will see a left hand column that has SAVED notes. User can CREATE notes on the left side column where it says'note title' , 'note text'. When the user has entered their note, an icon to save will appear at the top of the page. When the user clicks that save icon, the note will appear in the left hand column with other SAVED notes. If the user clicks on a SAVED note, it will appear in the right hand column so they can UPDATE it if they wish. If the user wants to CREATE a new note , they can click the '+' icon and new note entry boxes will appear. To DEELETE a note, the user can simply click the garbage can icon next to the note title.
